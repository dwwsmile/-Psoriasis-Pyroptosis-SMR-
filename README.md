# Psoriasis-Pyroptosis-SMR
This project employs ​​multi-omics Mendelian randomization​​ to investigate the causal role of pyroptosis-related genes in psoriasis pathogenesis. We integrated 593 pyroptosis-related coding genes from GeneCards with three large-scale psoriasis GWAS datasets (GCST90014456, FinnGen, UK Biobank) for discovery and validation.
Core analyses include:
​​· SMR analysis​​ of eQTL/mQTL/pQTL data to assess causal relationships
​​· Multi-SNP SMR​​ for enhanced statistical power
​​· Colocalization analysis​​ to identify shared causal variants
​​· HEIDI test​​ to exclude pleiotropic effects
The study reveals how pyroptosis genes influence psoriasis risk through transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic mechanisms, providing potential therapeutic targets. Includes complete bioinformatics pipeline in R.
