# Psoriasis-Pyroptosis-SMR
This project employs ​​multi-omics Mendelian randomization​​ to investigate the causal role of pyroptosis-related genes in psoriasis pathogenesis. We integrated 593 pyroptosis-related coding genes from GeneCards with three large-scale psoriasis GWAS datasets (GCST90014456, FinnGen, UK Biobank) for discovery and validation.
