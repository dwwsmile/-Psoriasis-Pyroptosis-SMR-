# Psoriasis-Pyroptosis-SMR
This study employs an integrated multi-omics framework to investigate the causal relationship between pyroptosis-related genes and psoriasis susceptibility. The analytical approach involved: 1) SMR analysis to test causal effects of gene expression, methylation, and protein abundance on psoriasis risk using top cis-QTLs (±1000 kb, P < 5×10⁻⁸); 2) Multi-SNP SMR integration; 3) HEIDI tests to exclude pleiotropy (P > 0.05); and 4) colocalization analysis to identify shared causal variants (PP.H4 > 0.5). Significant associations were defined by P_SMR < 0.05, P_SMR_multi < 0.05, and P_HEIDI > 0.05, with FDR correction applied. Analyses utilized SMR v1.3.1 and R v4.3.0, incorporating three independent psoriasis GWAS datasets and QTL data from eQTLGen, mQTL, and pQTL databases for discovery and validation.
